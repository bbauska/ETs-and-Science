		  Air Force Intelligence Officer</a><br>
          Former Air Force Intelligence Officer who came forward with claims regarding government’s 
          knowledge of UAPs.</p>

          <p>In 2023, David Grusch, a United States Air Force (USAF) officer and a former
		  intelligence official, was interviewed by various media outlets and testified 
		  in a U.S. congressional hearing. Grusch claimed that conversations with unnamed 
		  officials led him to believe that the U.S. federal government maintains a secretive 
		  ‘UAP’ recovery program and is in possession of “non-human” craft. In 2022, Grusch 
		  filed a whistleblower complaint with the U.S. Office of the Intelligence 
		  Community Inspector General to support his plan to share information with the 
		  U.S. Senate.</p>

          <p>He claims to have viewed documents reporting that Benito Mussolini’s government
		  recovered a “non-human” spacecraft in 1933, which the Vatican and the Five Eyes 
		  assisted the U.S. in procuring in 1944 or 1945. Grusch claims second-hand knowledge 
		  that American citizens have been harmed and killed as part of their government’s 
		  efforts to cover-up the information. In response to his claims from June 2023, 
		  the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) and the U.S. Department 
		  of Defense (DoD) stated that no evidence of extraterrestrial life had been 
		  discovered and that there was no verifiable information about anyone 
		  possessing and reverse engineering any “extraterrestrial materials”.</p>
		  <p>In a testimony given to the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and 
		  Accountability in July 2023, Grusch repeated several claims under oath. 
		  Testimonies were also delivered by Ryan Graves, a retired fighter pilot, 
		  and David Fravor, a retired U.S. Navy commander, on their experiences 
		  related to UFOs. Grusch testified that he could not elaborate publicly 
		  on some aspects, but offered to provide further details to representatives 
		  in a sensitive compartmented information facility (SCIF)..</p>

          Director AARO</a><br>
          Newly appointed (Aug 2024) Director of AARO, overseeing UAP investigations.</p>
          <p>In August 2024 Dr. Jon T. Kosloski was appointed as the director of the All-domain 
Anomaly Resolution Office (AARO), the Pentagon’s official hub for investigating 
Unidentified Anomalous Phenomena (UAP).

<p>Before joining AARO, Dr. Kosloski held various technical and leadership positions 
within the Research Directorate of the National Security Agency (NSA), where he 
served as a subject matter expert in free space optics and advised multiple 
Department of Defense agencies. He led advanced mission-oriented research in 
networking and computing, and he invented an advanced language-agnostic search 
engine while also working at the DoD Special Communications Enterprise Office.</p>

<p>Dr. Kosloski holds a Ph.D. in Electrical Engineering from Johns Hopkins University, 
along with Bachelor’s degrees in Mathematics and Physics from California State 
University, San Bernardino. His extensive experience includes a focus on quantum 
optics and crypto-mathematics, and he is a graduate of NSA’s Cryptanalysis 
Development Program. His doctoral research involved inventing novel devices that 
leverage principles from quantum optics to receive very weak phase-encoded signals, 
collaborating with scientists from the National Institute of Standards and 
Technology to achieve record sensitivities.</p>

<p>In his role as AARO director, Dr. Kosloski will lead the Department of Defense’s efforts 
to address UAP incidents affecting the U.S. military, coordinating with the Intelligence 
Community to minimize technical and intelligence surprises.</p>

<p>He will oversee the synchronization of scientific, intelligence, and operational efforts 
related to the detection, identification, attribution, and mitigation of UAP. Additionally, 
he will support the production of congressionally mandated reports on AARO’s caseload of 
resolved and unresolved UAP incidents, examine the U.S. government’s historical record 
on UAP, and work on declassifying and releasing relevant records to the public. Dr. 
Kosloski’s appointment aims to enhance AARO’s efforts in researching and explaining 
unidentified anomalous phenomena to the Department of Defense, Congress, and the 
American people.</p>
