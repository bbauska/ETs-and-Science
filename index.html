          <p>Former Air Force Intelligence Officer who came forward with claims regarding government’s 
		  knowledge of UAPs.</p>
          <p>In 2023, David Grusch, a United States Air Force (USAF) officer and a former intelligence official, 
		    was interviewed by various media outlets and testified in a U.S. congressional hearing. Grusch 
			claimed that conversations with unnamed officials led him to believe that the U.S. federal 
			government maintains a secretive ‘UAP’ recovery program and is in possession of “non-human” 
			craft. In 2022, Grusch filed a whistleblower complaint with the U.S. Office of the Intelligence 
			Community Inspector General to support his plan to share information with the U.S. Senate.</p>
          <p>He claims to have viewed documents reporting that Benito Mussolini’s government recovered a 
		    “non-human” spacecraft in 1933, which the Vatican and the Five Eyes assisted the U.S. in 
			procuring in 1944 or 1945. Grusch claims second-hand knowledge that American citizens have 
			been harmed and killed as part of their government’s efforts to cover-up the information. 
			In response to his claims from June 2023, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
			(NASA) and the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) stated that no evidence of extraterrestrial 
			life had been discovered and that there was no verifiable information about anyone 
			possessing and reverse engineering any “extraterrestrial materials”.</p>
          <p>In a testimony given to the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Accountability in July 
		    2023, Grusch repeated several claims under oath. Testimonies were also delivered by Ryan 
			Graves, a retired fighter pilot, and David Fravor, a retired U.S. Navy commander, on their 
			experiences related to UFOs. Grusch testified that he could not elaborate publicly on some 
			aspects, but offered to provide further details to representatives in a sensitive 
			compartmented information facility (SCIF)..</p>

<p>,j,
I he gist of what follows was presented at a special session of the annual
meetings of the American Association for
the Advancement of Science (AAAS) held
in Neu York on May 29, 1984. The morning u.ros devoted fo o discussion of what
the AAAS calls "The Edges of Science"
which according to them includes Porapsychology, the Search t'or Extraterrestrial
life, and UFOs. Issoc Asimov and Arthur
C. Clarke introduced the general theme of
the meeting. The following expresses the
viewpoint of Hynek on the UFO Phenomenon (and not on either parapsychology or
ETI). Our views of Oberg's presentation
at this same meeting are the subject of the
editorial in fhis issue.
Knowing that I faced at least a highly
skeptical, if not downright hostile, audience
of some 600 scientists, I determined to
alter my usual approach when talking to
more sympathetic audiences. Instead then
of presenting, in the limited time, two or at
most three highly interesting and representative oomples to illustrate the OFO phenomenon, I chose to present 400 cases!
This approach can perhaps be illustrated in
this way: suppose on a hike through the
mountains you came upon a variety of
rocks of different shapes, colors, and to<-
tures which you had reason to believe were
in some way different from the sunounding
rocks. Now you could, in describing your
findings select two or three rocks and
describe them to your audience. Skeptics
in you audience could, however, easily say
that you had "planted" those rocks, or that
there was really nothing special about them
at all, and that there was really nothing
about them that was different from all the
sunounding rocks. Merely describing their
outward appearance might not be enough
to convince others that you really had special rocks to display.
r
If, however, you ground up all the special rocks and isolated all the individual
minerals they contained, and you did the
same for the common ordinary rocks you
found lying about, and could show that
your rocks contained minerals the others
didn't, you'd prove your case.
What ldid, in effect, was to "grind up"
by computer the 400 selected OFO cases,
isolate the special "minerals" and show that
these were indeed different from the contents of the lFOs. Dropping our illustration
entirely now (maybe it was more confusing
than helpful), the 400 cases were selected
on the basis of the following criteria: Cases
by J. Allen Hynek
that I had personally investigated; cases
which had been investigated by ufologists
whose methods and integrify I have come
to respect; cases which had multiple and
especially independent witnesses (by inde
pendent I mean witnesses separated
geographically by perhaps a block or more,
and who generally did not know each other
nor communicated with each other).
How, now, did these cases differ in
content from the typical IFO cases? To find
out, each case was carefully analped for its
"properties." That is, each of the information bits, or information capsules, it contained was coded and introduced into the
computer. Thus, if a report stated that the
UFO "hovered," code HG was used; if it
appeared at tree-top level (a frequently
reported item) code fi was assigned; if it
exhibited truly anomalous acceleration,
code AA was assigned, and so on. Nearly
200 indMdual properties of that sort were
isolated. The computer was now asked to
arrange these properties in order of fre'
quency. Taking now the most frequently
reported properties the question was asked:
"How do these prop,erties, or combinofion
of properties, differ from the properties and
combination of properties of UFO reports
wtrich tumed out to be IFO reports?
Tn. unr*", was indeed that there is a
real difference (of course, ufologists had
known this all along, but in science unproved opinions carry little weight and here
a scientific audience was being addressed).
Furthermore, the particular group was the
American Associofion t'or the Aduancement of Science. What better, then, to
speak in terms of the process by which
science advances. ln "UFO ExPerience,"
hofessor Thomas Goudge, then Chairman
of the Department of Philosophy at the
University of Toronto, and a specialist on
the philosophy of science, had been quoted
on this very subject.
"One of the most interesting facets of
the UFO question to me is its bearing on
the problems of how science advances.
Roughly I would say that a necessary condi'
tion of scientific advancement is that allow'
ance must be made for (l) genuinely new
empirical observations and (2) new explanation schemes, including new basic concepts
and new laws."
By new empirical observations is meant
something that previously did not fit into
the cunent scientific outlook as, for instance, the first observations of bacteria or
the first observation of the induction of
electrical currents. Both of those required
an alteration in the everyday scientific
outlook
?r
\Ioudge pointed out that throughout
history any new scheme of explanation,
novel and resisted at first, eventually itself
becomes a part of the establishment and in
turn comes to resist admitting new emPirical observations into the framework of that
explanation scheme; e.9., note the difficulty
meteorites, fossils, the circulation of the
blood, bacteria, ball lightning, continental
drift, etc., had of being admitted onto the
respectable playing field of science.
It follows then that the present estab
lishment view that UFO reports do not rep
resent new empirical data, and a refusal to
look at the data, comes dangerously close
to rejecting a necessary condition of scien'
tific advance (which is what the meetings of
the Association for the Advancement of
Science are supposed to be about!)
Now it is quite clear, as we all know
only too well, that the contents of many
initial OFO reports do not rePresent new
empirical information: the host of clearly
demonstrated misinterpretations of balloons, aircraft, planets, meteors, rockets,
satellites, etc., attest to that. The question,
however, is: ls there a substantial body of
reports whose contents do contain something entirely new to us and to science, in
any area of human experience?
By concent ating on those properties,
or information capsules most frequently
contained in UFO reports from many countries, many levels of economic and social
status, and different levels of education and
technical training, and comparing them
with the most frequenUy reported ProPer'
ties of UFO reports which later upon exami'
nation proved to be IFOs, the answer comes
out YES.
The results of the full stud, now in
progress, will be published in full at a later
date, but some examples here should suffice to establish the above conclusion. Consider the following indMdual very frequently
reported properties:</p>
